Teaching Experience
-------------

I was a teaching assistant for UC Berkeley's data structures course
(three semesters), algorithms course (one semester), and synthetic biology course
 (one semester). I also lectured for the linear algebra section and the probability section for Columbia University's Math Tools for Neuroscience course (two semesters).

Here are examples of notes and practice problems I created for students:

 - [Git](/notes/git.html)
 - [Java Intro](/notes/java_intro.html)
 - [Java: Static and Dynamic Typing](/notes/StaticDynamic.pdf)
 - [Asymptotic Analysis](/notes/Asymptotics.pdf)
 - Midterm 1 Review: [[Worksheet](/notes/MT-1-Review.pdf)] [[Solutions](/notes/MT-1-Review-Sols.pdf)]
 - [HashCodes and HashMaps](/notes/Hashing.pdf)
 - [Binary Search Trees](/notes/BinarySearchTree.pdf)
 - [Balanced Search Trees](/notes/BalancedSearchTrees.pdf)
 - Midterm 2 Review: [[Worksheet](/notes/MT-2-Review.pdf)] [[Solutions](/notes/MT2-Solutions.pdf)]
 - [Graphs](/notes/Graphs.pdf)
 - [Graph Algorithms](/notes/GraphAlgorithms.pdf)
 - [Sorting Algorithms](/notes/SortingI.pdf)
 - [Disjoint Sets and Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms](/notes/Kruskals-DisjointSets.pdf)
 - Finals Review: [[Worksheet](/notes/FinalReview-Worksheet.pdf)] [[Solutions](/notes/FinalReview-Solutions.pdf)]

Writing Experience
-------------

I wrote a [profile article](https://scisub.com/2020/10/05/keven-laboy-juarez/) for Scientist on the Subway, one of Columbia neuroscience's outreach efforts that tells the diverse stories of scientists in the field.
 
I also wrote a short environmental awareness article (["Joshua Tree"](https://issuu.com/wowjournal/docs/journal_2016_final?e=11454900%2F38192403)) for _Words of the Watershed_ journal, a student-run journal at UC Berkeley.
