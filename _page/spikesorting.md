Working on optimizing neural spike detection algorithms, using MatLab and implementing Franke's Bayes-optimal template matching algorithm. Current objectives include improving upon Franke's linear discriminant analysis method for developing a filter. Challenges include finding efficient means of analysis for the very large data set
