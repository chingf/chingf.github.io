title: Neural Coding of Whisker Timing in Multi-Whisker Sensation
permalink: /projects/thesis.html
cover: /ching-photos/poster-photo.png
---

Used machine learning methods to examine how multi-whisker stimuli are encoded in the mouse brain and to propose a possible encoding method. Presented research at Berkeley's MCB poster session and the California Cognitive Science Conference, with a best presentation award at the former. Methods I used: modeling of over-dispersed Poisson processes using negative binomial distributions, logistic regression with L1 regularization, feature selection, low pass filtering of neural signals, PCA, community detection algorithms for graphs.
