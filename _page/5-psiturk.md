Implemented the front-end, back-end, and data processing code of a cognitive science experiment. Used HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and Pandas. The app was created on top of Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and hosted on [OpenShift](https://github.com/deargle/openshift-psiturk-cartridge). The goal of the experiment was to use reinforcement learning models to understand how people could learn increasingly heirarchical rules.

This project was done during my time at Anne Collin's Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab in UC Berkeley.
