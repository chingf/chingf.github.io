This was a project for Berkeley's EE106A/2006A, completed in a group of three students. I was responsible for programming the path-planning and controls aspect of the project, as well as general debugging. You can find our full project description, implementation, videos, and conclusions [here](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/diagnosticrobot/introduction). Github repository found [here](https://github.com/M777A2/ros_workspaces)

This was a proposed project by two engineers interested in making a medical robot start-up. I will continue working on this project in Spring 2018.
