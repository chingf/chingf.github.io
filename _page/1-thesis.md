title: Neural Coding of Whisker Timing in Multi-Whisker Sensation

Used machine learning methods to examine how multi-whisker stimuli are encoded in the mouse brain and to propose a possible encoding method. Presented research at Berkeley's MCB poster session and the California Cognitive Science Conference, with a best presentation award at the former. I modeled neural firing rates as over-dispersed Poisson processes using negative binomial distributions.
