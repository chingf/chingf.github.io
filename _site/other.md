I wrote a [profile article](https://scisub.com/2020/10/05/keven-laboy-juarez/) for Scientist on the Subway, one of Columbia neuroscience's outreach efforts that tells the diverse stories of scientists in the field.
 
I also wrote a short environmental awareness article (["Joshua Tree"](https://issuu.com/wowjournal/docs/journal_2016_final?e=11454900%2F38192403)) for _Words of the Watershed_ journal, a student-run journal at UC Berkeley.
