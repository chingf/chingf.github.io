Helpful Videos
-------------
Review videos are super helpful in the data structures part of the course! Here are a few people who made great resources
on data structures (I found these to be extremely useful when I was taking the course):

 - [5 Minute Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlipSLnrfrUlclWAcvmyxcn6R7tzwALhM)
	These videos hit on all the main points of each data structure in a quick, easy-to-review way 
 - [Graph Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlpu2f2g8ltqaaCZiq6GJvl1j)
	Much more in-depth review of graph algorithms with examples, pseudo-code, and actual code implementation
