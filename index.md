<font size="6"> Hi, I'm Ching!</font>
I am a PhD candidate at Columbia University's neuroscience program, co-advised by Larry Abbott and Dmitriy Aronov. I work in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience.

I am interested in understanding representation learning in artificial systems tested on real-world tasks and using these findings to gain insight into brain function. I also want to explore how principles from neural systems can guide the design of AI models and algorithms.

In the Abbott and Aronov labs, I work on mechanistic models of
memory formation and retrieval, taking inspiration from advances in machine learning. I previously did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and molecular & cell biology. There, I worked in the lab of Jose Carmena in understanding how neural circuits drive neuroprosthetic learning.
