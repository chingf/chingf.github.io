    <font size="5"> Hi, I'm Ching!</font>
    <p>I work on research in AI and neuroscience. I'm interested in studying mechanistic circuits behind cognitive behaviors (for example, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19686">transformers that in-context reinforcement learn</a>) and understanding how representation structures influence learning (for example, from self-supervised learning in <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=agPpmEgf8C">deep RL models</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16424">multimodal foundation models</a>). </p>
    <p>I am currently a research fellow at the Cambridge-Boston Alignment Initiative, after working as a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University. I completed my PhD at Columbia University's Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, where my research centered on models of episodic memory in the hippocampus and key-value memory. I was also a previous ML research intern at Apple, working on multimodal foundation models for biosignals. I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and molecular biology at UC Berkeley, where I worked on research studying learning in brain-machine interfaces.</p>
