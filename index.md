<font size="8"> Hi, I'm Ching!</font>

I am a PhD candidate at Columbia University's Neurobiology
& Behavior program, co-advised by Larry Abbott and Dmitriy Aronov.

I am broadly interested in understanding how biological circuits can support learning and memory.

Within the Abbott and Aronov labs, I work on mechanistic models of
memory formation and retrieval, occasionally taking inspiration from models used in AI.

Previously, I finished my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science
and molecular & cell biology. There, I worked in the lab of Jose Carmena in understanding
how neural circuits drive neuroprosthetic learning.
