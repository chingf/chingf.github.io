    <font size="5"> Hi, I'm Ching!</font>
    <p>I am a postdoc at Harvard University in <a href="https://www.rajanlab.com/">Kanaka Rajan's lab</a>. I am interested in theoretical neuroscience and NeuroAI research. I completed my PhD at Columbia University's Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, co-advised by Larry Abbott and Dmitriy Aronov.</p>
    <p>I am interested in understanding representation learning in artificial systems tested on real-world tasks and using these findings to gain insight into brain function. I also want to explore how principles from neural systems can guide the design of AI models and algorithms.</p>
    <p>In the Abbott and Aronov labs, I worked on mechanistic models of memory formation and retrieval, taking inspiration from advances in machine learning. I previously did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science and molecular & cell biology. There, I worked in the lab of Jose Carmena to understand how neural circuits drive neuroprosthetic learning. I also worked in the labs of Daniel Feldman and Anne Collins.</p>
