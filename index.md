<font size="6"> Hi, I'm Ching!</font>
I am a PhD candidate at Columbia University's neuroscience program, co-advised by Larry Abbott and Dmitriy Aronov. I work in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience.

I am broadly interested in understanding how biological circuits can support learning and memory.

In the Abbott and Aronov labs, I work on mechanistic models of
memory formation and retrieval, taking inspiration from models used in AI.

I previously did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, where I studied computer science
and molecular & cell biology. There, I worked in the lab of Jose Carmena in understanding
how neural circuits drive neuroprosthetic learning.
